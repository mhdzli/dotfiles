# xinitrc runs automatically when you run startx.

# There are some small but important commands that need to be run when we start
# the graphical environment. I keep those commands in ~/.xprofile because that
# file is run automatically if someone uses a display manager (login screen)
# and so they are needed there. To prevent doubling up commands, I source them
# here with the line below.

[ -f ~/.xprofile ] && . ~/.xprofile


# Here we start dwm.
# The loop is just to enable dwm's "restart" feature (mod+F2).
#exec dwm
