# Sorts incoming notifications by time and/or priority in as cending(+) or descending(-) order.
# +/-time | +/-priority
# sort=-time 

# Show notifications on the specified output. If empty, notifications will appear on the focused output.
# Requires the compositor to support the Wayland protocol xdg-output-unstable-v1 version 2.
# Default: ""
# output=name

# Arrange mako at the specified layer, relative to normal windows. Supported values are background, bottom, top, and
# overlay. Using overlay will cause notifications to be displayed above fullscreen windows, though this may also occur
# at top depending on your compositor.
# Default: top
# layer=layer

# Show notifications at the specified position on the output.
# Supported values are top-right, top-center, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-center, bottom-left, and center.
# Default: top-right
# anchor=position

## STYLE OPTIONS
# Set font to font, in Pango format.
# Default: monospace 10
font=monospace 14

# Set width of notification popups.
# Default: 300
# width=px

# Set maximum height of notification popups. Notifications
# whose text takes up less space are shrunk to fit.
# Default: 100
# height=px  

# Set margin of each edge to the size specified by direc# tional. See DIRECTIONAL VALUES for more information.
# Default: 10
# margin=directional 

# Set padding on each side to the size specified by direc# tional. See DIRECTIONAL VALUES for more information.
# Default: 5
# padding=directional 

# Set popup border size to px pixels.
# Default: 1
# border-size=px 

# Set popup border color to color. See COLORS for more infor# mation.
# Default: #4C7899FF
# border-color=color 

# Set popup corner radius to px pixels.
# Default: 0
# border-radius=px 

# Set popup progress indicator color to color. See COLOR for
# more information. To draw the progress indicator on top of
# the background color, use the over attribute. To replace the
# background color, use the source attribute (this can be use# ful when the notification is semi-transparent).
# Default: over #5588AAFF
# progress-color=[over|source] color 

# Show icons in notifications.
# Default: 1
# icons=0|1 

# Set maximum icon size to px pixels.
# Default: 64
# max-icon-size=px 

# Paths to search for icons when a notification specifies a
# name instead of a full path. Colon-delimited. This approxi# mates the search algorithm used by the XDG Icon Theme Speci# fication, but does not support any of the theme metadata.
# Therefore, if you want to search parent themes, you'll need
# to add them to the path manually.
# /usr/share/icons/hicolor and /usr/share/pixmaps are always
# searched.
# Default: ""
# icon-path=path[:path...]

# If 1, enable Pango markup. If 0, disable Pango markup. If
# enabled, Pango markup will be interpreted in your format
# specifier and in the body of notifications.
# Default: 1
# markup=0|1

# Applications may request an action to be associated with ac# tivating a notification. Disabling this will cause mako to
# ignore these requests.
# Default: 1
# actions=0|1

# Set notification format string to format. See FORMAT SPECI# FIERS for more information. To change this for grouped noti# fications, set it within a grouped criteria.
# Default: <b>%s</b>\n%b Default when grouped: (%g)
# <b>%s</b>\n%b
# format=format

# If set, mako will ignore the expire timeout sent by notifi# cations and use the one provided by default-timeout instead.
# Default: 0
# ignore-timeout=0|1

# A comma-separated list of criteria fields that will be com# pared to other visible notifications to determine if this
# one should form a group with them. All listed criteria must
# be exactly equal for two notifications to group.
# Default: none
# group-by=field[,field,...]

# CRITERIA
# In addition to the set of options at the top of the file, the
# config file may contain zero or more sections, each containing
# any combination of the STYLE OPTIONS. The sections, called criteria, are defined with an INI-like square bracket syntax. The
# brackets may contain any number of fields, like so:
#[field=value field2=value2 ...]

# When a notification is received, it will be compared to the
# fields defined in each criteria. If all of the fields match, the
# style options within will be applied to the notification. Fields
# not included in the criteria are not considered during the
# match. A notification may match any number of criteria. This
# matching occurs in the order the criteria are defined in the
# config file, meaning that if multiple criteria match a notifica# tion, the last occurrence of any given style option will "win".

# The following fields are available in criteria:
# •app-name (string)
# •app-icon (string)
# •summary (string)

# An exact match on the summary of the notification.
# •urgency (one of "low", "normal", "high")
# •category (string)
# •desktop-entry (string)
# •actionable (boolean)
# •expiring (boolean)
# •grouped (boolean)

# Whether the notification is grouped with any others (its
# group-index is not -1).
# •group-index (int)
#•The notification's index within its group, or -1 if it
# is not grouped.
# •hidden (boolean)
#•hidden is special, it defines the style for the place# holder shown when the number of notifications or groups
# exceeds max-visible.

# If a field's value contains special characters, they may be es# caped with a backslash, or quoted:
#[app-name="Google Chrome"]
#[app-name=Google\ Chrome]

# Quotes within quotes may also be escaped, and a literal back# slash may be specified as \\. No spaces are allowed around the
# equal sign. Escaping equal signs within values is unnecessary.
# Additionally, boolean values may be specified using any of
# true/false, 0/1, or as bare words:
# [actionable=true] [actionable=1] [actionable]
# [actionable=false] [actionable=0] [!actionable]

# There are three criteria always present at the front of the
# list:
# •An empty criteria which matches all notifications and con#tains the defaults for all style options, overwritten with
#any configured in the global section.
# •[grouped], which sets the default format for grouped notifi#cations and sets them invisible.
# •[group-index=0], which makes the first member of each group
#visible again.
# These options can be overridden by simply defining the criteria
# yourself and overriding them.

# CRITERIA-ONLY STYLE OPTIONS
# Some style options are not useful in the global context and
# therefore have no associated command-line option.
# Whether this notification should be invisible even if it is
# above the max-visible cutoff. This is used primarily for
# hiding members of groups. If you want to make more than the
# first group member visible, turn this option off within a
# group-index criteria.
# Default: 0
# invisible=0|1

# COLORS
# Colors can be specified as #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA.

# DIRECTIONAL VALUES
# Some options set values that affect all four edges of a notifi# cation. These options can be specified in several different
# ways, depending on how much control over each edge is desired:
# •A single value will apply to all four edges.
# •Two values will set vertical and horizontal edges sepa#rately.
# •Three will set top, horizontal, and bottom edges separately.
# •Four will give each edge a separate value.

# When specifying multiple values, they should be comma-separated.
# For example, this would set the top margin to 10, left and right
# to 20, and bottom to five:
# margin=10,20,5

# FORMAT SPECIFIERS
# Format specification works similarly to printf(3), but with a
# different set of specifiers.
# %%Literal "%"
# \\Literal "\"
# \nNew Line

# For notifications
# %aApplication name
# %sNotification summary
# %bNotification body
# %gNumber of notifications in the current group

# For the hidden notifications placeholder
# %hNumber of hidden notifications
# %tTotal number of notifications
